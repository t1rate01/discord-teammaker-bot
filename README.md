# Discord Bot
Practising and getting my first touch of Python.

## Progress:
Added dropdown menu command for choosing  
a channel for queue feature and a cap before queue starts.  
Added first functionalities for queue joining, leaving and checking.  
Added bot event when a user joins targeted channel, checks for amount of users in the channel vs set cap, untested automation for asking with buttons about joining the queue.  
  
## Plans:  
Check if someone leaves target voice channel.  
Spread the code to be more modular.  
Call next from queue, joining/skipping functions.  
Slash commands.  
Tracker API with list of participants.

### Needs fixing  
Bot event and possibly elsewhere using db instead of local json for frequent checks.  Att roulette clumsy, maybe need to change to a map ban roulette and set operator bans with roulette and then assign random ops to each round (Att 1, 2, 3, Def 1,2,3)
